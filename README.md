# F2L Trainer

Basic F2L trainer based on [jperm's pdf](https://bit.ly/bestf2l) (algs, cases and general look). Currently this lacks several features generally encountered in this type of app (timer, session, session history, statistics, mobile support, etc.).

I build this because I wanted to practice specific cases and they were difficult/rare to come by in un-timed solves (or most likely I am too bad to spot them).
This is bare bones because I just wanted to practice and needed something quickly. I eventually added all the f2l cases (not just the ones I wanted to practice) and published it in case other people needed the same kind of tool.

If people find this useful and need the lacking features (timer, mobile support, history, etc.), I'm glad to implement them or accept pull requests.
